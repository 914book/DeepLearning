RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER MODEL And DEEP LEARNING MODEL

Since they can handle outliers and nonlinear data, I decided to use this model and compare it with deep learning model.

The result indicate RANDOM FOREST MODEL 72 % accuracy vx Deep learning model 75 % accuracy - Charity is successful 75% according to deep learning model and 72% according to Random Forest model.

For deep Learning Model - First hidden layer  input 38, 24 neuron units
                        - RELU activation
                        - Second Layer - 12 neuron untis with RELU activation
                        - The loss functions used adam optimizer
                        - max 50 epochs
